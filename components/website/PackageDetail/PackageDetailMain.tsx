                Everest Circuit Trek, also known as Everest Round Trek, is a
                classic expedition-style trek around the worldâ€™s seventh highest
                peak, Everest 8167m and its broad massif of 7000m peaks. Everest
                Circuit is a challenging trek in the western part of Nepal,
                offering full adventure and off the beaten path experience in
                the remote and unspoilt region of Nepal. Everest circuit trek
                itinerary travels through serene, isolated regions full of
                natural beauty, crossing through highlands and high passes with
                astonishing viewpoints. The route offers constant mountains
                views while passing through remote villages and astonishing
                landscape including several high passes, dense forests and
                glaciers. Our 20 days Everest circuit trek is a fully guided and
                supported trek with camping accommodation throughout the trek.
                Our journey to Everest round trek starts with a short flight to
                Pokhara and then followed by an off-road drive to Darbang the
                next day. Our actual trek commences from Darbang as we follow
                the well-paced itinerary which we have meticulously devised
                keeping every important aspect in mind.
